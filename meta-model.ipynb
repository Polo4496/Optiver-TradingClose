In this competition, we have to predict the closing price of hundreds Nasdaq-listed stocks based on the closing auction and order book of the stock.

First, there are a lot of missing values in the dataset, so we either have to impute them all, or just use model that can take care of it implicitly, which are XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. Second, the competition uses MAE as metric, and XGBoost's MAE loss function isn't good from my experience. Last, due to the size of the dataset, we want to use GPU to increase the speed, and guess what, CatBoost's MAE loss function can't be optimized with GPU.
